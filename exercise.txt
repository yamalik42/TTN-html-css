1. Block level elements initiate line breaks relative to its preceding and succeeding element. This is not
the case with inline level elements unless the content-contingent width of the inline element aggregated
with other preceding elements on the same line of the page exceeds the page width, in which case it will
initiate a line break relative to its preceding element. This distinction arises due to the fact that block
level elements take up the full width of the page, implying there can never be two block level elements on
the same line, whereas inline level elements only take up as much width as required by their contents.

2.  visibility: hidden -- the element will not be seen on the page except it will still take up the same space
                        as it would without the style attribute and retain all other qualitites expected of
                        an element devoid of the {visibility: hidden} attribute
    display: none -- element will not be seen on screen and will act as if it did not exist at all in its 
                    relation to other elements on the page. In particular, it won't take up any space or effect
                    spacing in any way.

3. Float affects the positioning of an element in relation to its neighboring floated/non-floated elements
which are part of the webpages "flow" (all elements with {position: relative/static})
